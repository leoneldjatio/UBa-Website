                    <h4>Founding</h4>
                    <p>
                        The University of BAMENDA was created by Decree n° 2010/371 of the 14th December 2010. The last of
                        the eight state Universities in Cameroon as primary concern, to achieve the goals attributed to all
                        the state Universities which include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teaching</li>
                        <li>Research</li>
                        <li>Outreach</li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="mission">
                    <h4>Mission</h4>
                    <p>
                        The mission of UBa is to equip students with universal knowledge in the arts, sciences and
                        technology. It strives to imbue in the students an overt spirit, reflective of critical and
                        constructive thinking, spontaneous to initiatives and enterprise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The university, to this end, brings the students to sanity as they imbibe, exchange and value ideas
                        within a context of moral integrity and associative life. Its critical agenda is to pursue personal
                        and collegial excellence in teaching, training, research and outreach in the spirit of the
                        Anglo-Saxon tradition without sacrificing the advantages of cultural dialogue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The learning experience which the university provides to students is the basis upon which students
                        should demonstrate responsible leadership and subscribe to the core values of intellectual insurance
                        responsive to the exigencies of the contemporary environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The university, conscious of the dynamic character of science and technology, will continue to
                        strive for innovation in its quest to meet with the ramified demands of our contemporary times.

                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>
                        The history of The University of Bamenda is inextricably linked to that of the Cameroon College of
                        Arts, Science and Technology (CCAST) and Ecole Normale Supérieure Annex (ENSAB) Bambili. The
                        University of Bamenda germinated out of a local initiative hatched in 1962 following reforms in the
                        Educational Policy of West Cameroon. The process was facilitated by the then Prime Minister and
                        later Vice President of the Federal Republic of Cameroon Dr. John Ngu Foncha. Foncha’s vision rested
                        on the standard of higher learning reflective of the Nigerian Colleges of Arts, Science and
                        Technology (NCAST). This wish was even more urgent because by 1961, the number of university
                        graduates was grossly inadequate to cope with the senior staff demands of the new nation state.
                        There were slightly over twenty university graduates in the Southern Cameroons by 1962 and the top
                        civil service jobs by dint of this limitation were dominated by expatriates, mostly Nigerians and
                        British.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was in dire need to allay this problem that the West Cameroon Government through its Education
                        Policy Paper of July 1963 envisaged CCAST as a future college of the Federal University of Cameroon
                        created in 1962. In the context of the imagination, it was to assume the status of an American
                        Junior College or the English Polytechnic. This dream was somehow constrained by logistics and human
                        resources. This perhaps explains why in 1963 when CCAST was transferred from its temporary site at
                        GTTC Kumba to Bambili, USAID came in to lend support to firmly establish the institution, especially
                        in the Science Department. This took place under the auspices of Dr. David Laird, USAID Adviser on
                        Education, and Dr. William Stanley, Adviser on Science of Education. Mr. H. O. H. Vernon Jackson
                        from the United States became the pioneer Principal. The USAID ground breaking mission was quite
                        brief (1962 to 1963). Mr. Sylvester Dioh stands out prominent as one of the key Cameroonian figures
                        in the early development of CCAST Bambili. In December 1963, CCAST was transferred to its present
                        site in Bambili and Dioh appointed as Principal.

                        <p>
                            Between 1964 and 1966, landmark initiatives took place in CCAST which inaugurated the
                            forty-three years (1967-2010) march towards an Anglo-Saxon styled University of Bamenda. Early
                            in 1964 when Mr. (and later Dr.) Elias M. Nwana assumed interim responsibility as Principal of
                            CCAST while Dioh went abroad for further studies, they thought it prudent to allay the acute
                            dearth of trained teachers in Anglophone Cameroon secondary schools by giving a one-year
                            pedagogic training to GCE A-Level holders to equip them with contents and aptitudes to teach in
                            secondary schools. Besides, it was also a unique opportunity for Grade II teachers who were
                            admitted along with secondary school leavers to prepare themselves for entry into universities.
                            In 1966, the initiative was put in place and an Advanced College of Education attached to the
                            then CCAST Bambili was initiated. A dozen students were enrolled to take the course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In spite of this initial mobilisation, the program did not take-off successfully because the
                            Government stopped the scheme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1967, the Government through Ministerial Decision No. 38 of September 13, 1967 created an
                            annex of the Advanced Teacher Training College, (ENS) Yaounde, the School of Education of the
                            Federal University of Cameroon specialised in the training of teachers. In accordance with the
                            text creating the school, three programs (series) were opened.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1967 decision establishing this institution stipulated that ENS Annex Bambili (ENSAB) would
                            be jointly administered with CCAST. In this arrangement, the Principal of CCAST acted as
                            Director-Delegate of ENSAB. It was in this context that Mr. Dioh cumulated the functions of
                            Principal of CCAST and pioneer Director-Delegate of ENSAB from 1967 to 1970. After Mr. Dioh, six
                            other Director-Delegates piloted the affairs of the institution. These in chronological order
                            were:

                        <ol>
                            <li>Mr.Omer Weyih Yembe – 1970 / 1971 (Director Delegate and Principal of CCAST)</li>
                            <li>Dr. A. S. Bokosah – 1971 / 1974</li>
                            <li>Mr. M. Mofor – 1974 / 1989</li>

                            <li>Prof. Moses Fon Asanji – 1993 / 2000</li>
                            <li>Prof. Victor Bong AmazeeÂ – 2000 / 2004</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            From September 1967 to December 14, 2010 when the President of the Republic announced the
                            creation of The University of Bamenda, many developments took place, the most significant of
                            which was the ever increasing yearly intake and number of graduates the institution annually
                            produced. Appreciating that ENSAB has come of age especially in terms of the student enrolment
                            and the ever pressing need for higher learning opportunities in the region, the President’s 14
                            December 2010 solemn pronouncement of; “I am pleased to announce to you the creation of The
                            University of Bamenda” during the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the Armed Forces at the
                            Grandstand in Bamenda drew inexpressive euphoria from the length and breadth of the North West
                            Region. Before this historic proclamation, the Higher Education setting in Bambili had just
                            undergone some transformation. In 2009, Ministerial Decision No. 000009/MINESUP/ of 27 March
                            2009 by Prof. Jacques Fame Ndongo, Minister of Higher Education, brought drastic reforms in
                            ENSAB. The institution was given a full-fledged status with the creation of 18 departments
                            integrating training for general and technical education teachers for secondary schools. The
                            pioneer head of this new phase was Prof. Gwanfogbe Mathew Basung, hitherto the Director-Delegate
                            of ENSAB assisted by Dr Lukong Keneth Mengnjo. Meanwhile following Decree No. 2010/372 of 14
                            December 2010 creating The University of Bamenda, ENSAB was divided into two professional
                            Teacher Training Schools; Higher Teacher Training College (HTTC), to train teachers of Secondary
                            General Education and Higher Technical Teacher Training College (HTTTC), to train teachers of
                            Secondary Technical Education. The two schools were piloted by Prof. Gwanfogbe Mathew Basung and
                            Dr. Lukong Keneth Mengnjo as Acting Directors respectively, positions they held till October
                            2011 when the pioneer Vice Chancellor was installed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is worth mentioning that the March 8, 2011 decree organising The University of Bamenda
                            contained 96 articles which inter alia highlighted the Anglo-Saxon character (art.1) of the
                            University and proposed six faculties and five schools (art.49) to go operational within the
                            ambit of the resources available.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On Friday September 30, 2011, Professors Mvogo Dominique and Tafah Edward Oki Edokat were
                            appointed by the Head of State respectively as Pro-Chancellor and Vice Chancellor of the
                            University of Bamenda. On Monday 3 October 2011, they were formally commissioned into office by
                            the Minister of Higher Education and Chancellor of Academic Orders, Prof. Jacques Fame Ndongo,
                            as the pioneer Pro-Chancellor and Vice Chancellor respectively of The University of Bamenda. As
                            a mode of procedure to establish a working agenda for an effective take-off of the university,
                            the Vice Chancellor summoned two Senate meetings on 18 October 2011 and 1 March 2012
                            respectively. These culminated in the convening of the First University Council by the
                            Pro-Chancellor on 2 March 2012 where landmark resolutions were taken to guide the operational
                            framework of the University.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Earlier in December 2011, a Ministerial decision appointed the University officials from the
                            ranks of Deputy Vice Deans, Heads of Division, Heads of Department and some Chiefs of Service.
                            These personnel were commissioned on 21 December 2011 to their respective posts of
                            responsibility. Closely associated with this development was the recruitment of 102 Assistant
                            Lecturers from varied disciplines and some Administrative Assistants within the framework of the
                            Presidential 25.000 recruitment scheme and numerical replacement of lecturers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2012 new steam was injected into the University’s administration with the appointment of
                            Deputy Vice Chancellors, the Registrar, Deans and Directors of Schools and Faculties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is no gain saying that the University of Bamenda, one of the 8 State universities
                            currently existing bloomed out not only from the CCAST complex vision as well as from the ENSAB
                            idea, but more importantly, emerged from the deliberate design of the Head of State, President
                            Paul Biya who created the University “not merely to recount what has been but also to share in
                            moulding what should be” – The University of the Future, we dare say.
